# fitnessapp

## Project Descripton
"fitnessapp" is a fitness tracking web app. It lets users create profiles to track their workouts and visualise workout progression and -habits with graphs. 

This is a revamp of my final project from the "Harvard cs50x - Introduction to Computer Science" course. It is used as a portfolio project, as it illustrates the progression of my early progamming journey well. The idea was self-selected and implemented from end-to-end. The revamp included significant improvements in new features, database schemas, pages and design.

The tech stack includes popular web development technologies, as per project requirements:
- Python
- JavaScript
- Bootstrap
- Flask
- SQLite3
- HTML
- CSS

Challenges faced along the way are:
- designing and redesigning the relational database schema to cover known- and unknown use cases
- scope creep from new insights and unexpected technical issues
- learning new technologies ad-hoc
- balancing tradeoffs when researching frameworks and technologies
- planning and execution 

Potential future improvements:
- organise static folder with subfolders for each file type, such as "CSS", "JS" and "Images"
- organise app.py into modules with Flask blueprint, as the codebase has grown
- unit testing to ensure features are working as expected

All in all, building and revamping this project from end-to-end was a satisfying learning experience with exciting challenges. The know-how gained will aid in skilfully planning, managing scope creep, troubleshooting and implementing future technical projects.
